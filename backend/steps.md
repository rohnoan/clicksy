# üß± E-Commerce Backend Build Steps

## 1. Initialize Project
- Create project folder  
- Run `npm init -y`  
- Install dependencies (express, mongoose, dotenv, cors)  
- Install dev dependency (nodemon)  
- Add `"type": "module"` to package.json  
- Add start and dev scripts  

---

## 2. Create Folder Structure
- Create `src/` directory  
- Inside `src/`, add:
  - `config/` for DB and environment setup  
  - `middleware/` for global middlewares  
  - `modules/` for features (auth, user, product, order)  
  - `app.js` for Express setup  
  - `server.js` for app entry  
- Create `.env`, `.gitignore`, `README.md`, and update `package.json`

---

## 3. Build Entry Point
- Create a simple Express server that prints ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù  
- Confirm it runs successfully on the chosen port  

---

## 4. Connect Database
- Add environment variables (PORT, MONGO_URI)  
- Connect to MongoDB using Mongoose  
- Log connection success or failure  
- Verify connection works  

---

## 5. Add Middleware
- Add JSON parsing, CORS, and error-handling middleware  
- Centralize error handling in one file  
- Keep this layer generic for future use  

---

## 6. Refactor for Clean Structure
- Move Express app setup to `app.js`  
- Move DB logic to `config/db.js`  
- Keep `server.js` only for starting the server  
- Ensure everything still runs correctly  

---

## 7. Create Auth Module
- Add folder `src/modules/auth`  
- Add routes for register, login, and user info  
- Implement JWT-based authentication  
- Include password hashing and validation  
- Return tokens on login and registration  

---

## 8. Add Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Add roles (user, admin, seller) to user model  
- Create middleware to authorize routes based on roles  

---

## 9. Create User Module
- Handle profile retrieval and updates  
- Add address and wishlist management  
- Integrate order history from order module  

---

## 10. Create Product Module
- CRUD for products  
- Add category and search filters  
- Handle image uploads  
- Add rating and review support  

---

## 11. Create Order Module
- Manage cart, checkout, and order placement  
- Handle order status updates  
- Integrate payment flow (later)  
- Connect with product inventory updates  

---

## 12. Add Notifications (Later)
- Create service for email/SMS notifications  
- Send events like order placed, shipped, or delivered  

---

## 13. Add Search (Later)
- Integrate search indexing (ElasticSearch or similar)  
- Implement autocomplete and filtering  

---

## 14. Add Analytics (Later)
- Track user activity, sales, and revenue  
- Build admin analytics endpoints  

---

## 15. Add Recommendation System (Later)
- Generate product suggestions based on user behavior  

---

## 16. Add Admin Module
- Central dashboard for managing products, users, and orders  

---

## 17. Add Caching
- Integrate Redis for caching frequently accessed data  
- Use it for sessions, products, and rate limiting  

---

## 18. Integrate Event Bus (Advanced)
- Add Kafka or RabbitMQ for event-driven updates  
- Use for notifications, analytics, and stock sync  

---

## 19. Split into Microservices (Final Stage)
- Separate modules into independent services  
- Add API Gateway for unified routing  
- Use containerization (Docker) for each service  

---

## ‚úÖ Milestone Summary
1. Working Express server  
2. Connected MongoDB  
3. Modular structure ready  
4. Auth with JWT working  
5. Full CRUD for users, products, and orders  
6. Advanced layers: notifications, analytics, recommendations  
7. Event bus + microservices conversion
